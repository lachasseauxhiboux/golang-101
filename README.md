# Golang 101

Welcome to `Golang 101` â€“ your starting point to learn the Go programming language! This repository is designed to help beginners grasp the fundamentals of Go through examples, exercises, and comprehensive notes.

## Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Created by Google engineers, Go combines efficiency and effectiveness with a simple and readable syntax.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into various sections, each focusing on a core concept of the Go language:

# Basics
- `vars/` - Understanding variables and data types in Go.
- `const/` - Learning about constants and enumeration.
- `strings/` - String manipulation and standard library functions.
- `array/` - Working with arrays and understanding their properties.
- `map/` - Exploring maps and their usage in Go.
- `slice/` - Deep dive into slices and their operations.
- `struct/` - Structs and composition: Defining complex data types.

#  Advanced Concepts
- `functions/` - Fundamentals of function declaration and usage patterns.
- `interfaces/` - Understanding interface types and their role in Go's type system.
- `goroutines/` - Concurrency in Go with goroutines and channels.
- `channels/` - Synchronization and communication between goroutines using channels.
- `error_handling/` - Best practices for error handling and creating custom errors.
- `packages/` - Organizing code into packages and reusable modules.
- `testing/` - Writing tests using Go's built-in testing package.
- `benchmarking/` - Introduction to performance measurement with benchmarks in Go.
- `http/` - Building HTTP servers and clients with the net/http package.
- `templating/` - Using Go's templating engine to generate dynamic content.
- `database/` - Interacting with SQL and NoSQL databases.
- `websockets/` - Working with WebSockets for real-time communication.
- `reflection/` - Exploring Go's reflection capabilities for type introspection.
- `cgo/` - Combining Go with C code using cgo.
- `tooling/` - Using Go's tools and utilities for code formatting, linting, and more.
- `modules/` - Dependency management with Go modules.

# Project Examples
- `project_example/` 

Each directory contains two main types of files:

- `.md` files: These Markdown files contain notes, explanations, and theoretical concepts.
- `.go` files: Here, you'll find practical code examples demonstrating the concepts in action.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once Go is installed, you can clone this repository and navigate into each directory to explore the examples:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lachasseauxhiboux/golang-101.git
    cd golang-101

# How to Use This Repository

- Start with the `vars/` directory to understand the basics of variables in Go.
- Gradually move on to the next sections as you become comfortable with the language.
- Refer to the `.md` files for theoretical knowledge and explanations.
- Look at the `.go` files for practical examples. You can run any `.go` file using the command:

    ```bash
    go run filename.go
